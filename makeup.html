			<p> This is one of my favorite looks that I've ever done. I was inspired by the colors of the transgender flag and NikkieTutorials' recent coming out story. I wanted to show my support for her and my friends who don't identify as cisgender. </p> <BR CLEAR=”left”/>

			<p> This look is where I began experimenting with darker lips shades. It was really empowering for me to so be bold in my choice. I didn't have any dark lip stick color so I used eyeshadows to create this instead. Originally, I had a nude lip on but I wanted to challenge myself and try something new with my makeup. I put a lipgloss over it to make it look less dry and more like actual lipstick. Also, if you look closely, there's a pop of orange underneath my eyes. This is one way to combine two colors that you wouldn't think go together.</p>

			<p> I actually created this look by mistake! I've always been a huge fan of rainbows, every since I was a little kid. I knew I wanted to do a colorful look but my original intention was to create a cut crease. However, I have a slight tremor in my hands, especially when I concentrate. When I was trying to creat a straight line for the cut crease, I messed it up. Instead of redoing all the blending of the colors on my eyes, I made the mistake intentional and created a cloud cut crease instead. I had a lot of fun with this look because I had never seen anything like it before.</p> <BR CLEAR=”left”/>

		<img src="images/makeup4.jpeg" id="makeup4" width="210" height="270" align="right" hspace="50">
		<div class="jumbotron">
			<p> This is one of the first makeup looks I did using bright colors. I just went through extensive wrist surgery on my nondominant hand and needed a way to pass the time. I've always watched beauty influencers on youtube play with colors so I attempted the same thing. Through the pain and recovery, makeup was something I was able to experiment with and find a new love for. My friends were so amazed at the time because makeup was all about looking natural and pretending like you weren't wearing anything. These first experiementations allowed me to embrace a new form of art that I still treasure to this day.</p> <BR CLEAR="right"/>
